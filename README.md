Made a mp3 player 
has a basic ui
has a pause/play button
has the song title and artist as well as the time stamp and a timeline 
has a skip button 
has a rewind button 

its supposed to support multiple mp3 files but I seem to be facing a too big of a logic error to fix at the moment so im just going to post the code and try on another day to come back to this project with a new brain and better experience perhaps 
the issue with it is that it doesnt play the next song and the play and pause button doesnt work as well as the rewind or skip but the drag does work and you can skip through the song and listen but you arent able to pause it after and the time doesnt sync with the timeline
